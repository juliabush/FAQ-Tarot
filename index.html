            Tarot is a deck of symbolic cards used for guidance,
            self-reflection, and exploring inner thoughts or life situations.
            Each card carries its own imagery and meaning, often drawing on
            archetypes and emotional themes.

      <div class="question">
        <div class="rhetorical-question">Is tarot accurate?</div>
        <div class="description">
          <div class="description-body">
            Tarot is less about predicting the future and more about offering
            insight. Its accuracy often depends on the clarity of the question
            and the openness of the person receiving the reading—it's a
            reflective tool, not a fixed answer.

          <div class="description-body">
            Being specific in your question helps the Tarot AI give you a more
            tailored and meaningful response. General questions work too, but
            more detail can bring out deeper and more relevant insights from the
            cards.

        <div class="rhetorical-question">How can I learn more about tarot?</div>
        <div class="description">
          <div class="description-body">
            You can learn more through books, online resources, and even by
            practicing with a deck yourself. Understanding the symbolism of each
            card and trying simple spreads can quickly deepen your connection
            with the tarot.
